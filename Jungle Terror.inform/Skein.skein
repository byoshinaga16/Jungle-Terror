You open your eyes. Your eyesight is blurry and it takes a while for you to realize that you are staring straight up at the cloudless blue sky. The faint squawk of birds slowly gets louder as you come back to your senses.  Still in a daze, you slowly sit up and look around. You find yourself sitting on the soft white sand of an empty beach. How in the world did you end up here? Your clothes is tattered and your entire body aches with pain. Carefully, you stand up and walk around, letting the warm sand slip through your bare toes. After examining your surroundings a bit more, you realize that you&apos;re on a small Island.

Jungle Terror
An Interactive Fiction by Braden Yoshinaga
Release 1 / Serial number 140306 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Beach
A beautiful white sand beach that stretches around the entire island. Waves from the vast, sapphire ocean gently lap the shore. The sand here is littered with many crab holes. Palm trees line the dirt farther north up the beach.

You can see a thin line here.
